    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>In this class we are only going to be using vscode to commit to github.</p>
    <p>The steps necessary are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make changes to code</li>
      <li>Ensure the changes are saved</li>
      <li>The src control icon on the left will show a number which indicates the number of files that have been changed</li>
      <li>click on the src control icon</li>
      <li>stage the files you want to commit by clicking the + </li>
      <li>enter a commit message and click on "commit" to commit the files (these changes are only on your computer at this point)</li>
      <li>click the "sync" button to move the files to github (if successful, you should see them in your account in github)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Barely more advanced</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of tools to help with git, but you can simply use the command line in a terminal</p>
    <p>Below is as simple as I can make it, there is much, much more you can do!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>git status - to show status of files</li>
      <li>git add "filename" - to stage the file</li>
      <li>git commit -m 'message' - commits staged files with commit message</li>
      <li>git push - pushes the committed messages to your github account</li>
      <li>git pull - grab the current state in github</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
